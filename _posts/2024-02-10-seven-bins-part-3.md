In this series, I'm using public data to answer a question about recycling in England. Within this project I'll be accessing [open government data](https://www.data.gov.uk) and exploring options to gather data that isn't yet stored in a public database ([crowdsourcing](https://www.clickworker.com/customer-blog/data-crowdsourcing/) vs [freedom of information request](https://www.gov.uk/make-a-freedom-of-information-request/how-to-make-an-foi-request)).
